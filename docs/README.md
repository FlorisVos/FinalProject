I have made an interactive story-riddle-game app.
It tells a story through text that is appended when the user clicks on one of two buttons. Most of the time the buttons don't affect the story but the user can get stuck in loops within the story that  can only be escaped by giving the correct answer to a riddle. Hints to the riddle are given in the loop and when the user entered the correct answer the story can be continued.
